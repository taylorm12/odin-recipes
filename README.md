Project: Recipes from TOP

Hi, This is one of my first projects from The Odin Project. I'm currently involved in a computer science degree and wanted to diversify my portfolio by learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is the first of many projects that I will be working on until completion in my free time.

This project is the entry-level HTML which will indicate that I have successfully learned and implemented Elements, Tags, Boilerplates, Texts, Lists, Links and Images, and more.
